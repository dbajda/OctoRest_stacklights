# OctoRest_stacklights

Industrial stack lights controller for Octoprint based on Raspberry Pi GPIO using python with GPIOzero and OctoREST libraries.
Very simple project as I'm total newbie in python and trying to learn more. 

You simply enter Octoprint host and API key and connect relay board to defined GPIO pins and run it.

TO DO:
 - more comments in code
 - clean up the code
 - add a "printer turned off" status
 - and more
